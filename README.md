# 👋 Hi, I'm Opeoluwa Shodipe

I'm a research-driven and detail-oriented Biomedical Scientist with a strong foundation in molecular biology, infectious disease genomics, and bioinformatics. My expertise spans nucleic acid extraction, quantitative PCR, and genomic surveillance of high-burden pathogens, including HIV, TB, Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, and Monkeypox. With growing proficiency in computational biology and data science, I leverage tools like Python, R, Galaxy, Nextflow, and Bioconductor to extract actionable insights from complex biological datasets.

I’m passionate about the intersection of public health and computational technologies, and I am actively transitioning into advanced data science and AI applications. My recent training has expanded my skill set to include statistical modeling, data wrangling, workflow automation, and functional enrichment analysis. I aim to integrate AI-driven approaches into biomedical research, with a focus on machine learning, R-based analytics, and scalable pipelines for genomic data interpretation.

Committed to continuous learning and collaboration, I contribute to open science and reproducible research through version-controlled codebases and documented workflows.
