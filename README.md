# 👋 Hi, I'm Opeoluwa Shodipe

I'm a research-driven and detail-oriented research assistant with a strong foundation in microbiology, molecular biology, infectious disease genomics, and bioinformatics. My expertise spans across nucleic acid extraction, quantitative PCR, NGS, and genomic surveillance of high-burden pathogens, including HIV, HPV, Hepatitis, TB, Malaria, Arboviruses, and Monkeypox. Currently, I have a growing proficiency in computational biology and data science, I leverage tools like Linux, Python, R, Galaxy, and Bioconductor to extract actionable insights from simple to complex biological datasets.

I’m passionate about contributing to the development of computational tools or approaches for resolving challenges specific to resource-limited settings, and I am actively transitioning into advanced data science and AI applications. My recent training has expanded my skill set to include statistical modeling, data wrangling, and functional enrichment analysis for cancer research. I aim to integrate AI-driven approaches into biomedical research, with a focus on Linux and R-based analytics, machine learning, and scalable pipelines for genomic data interpretation.

I am committed to continuous learning, networking, and collaborations.
